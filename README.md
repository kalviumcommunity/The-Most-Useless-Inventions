# The Most Useless Inventions  

## Project Overview  
This project is a simple, interactive webpage where users can explore a list of the most hilariously pointless inventions. Users can add their own inventions (stored locally), vote on their favorites, and sort them by popularity. Everything runs on the frontend using local storage.  

## Key Features  
- A fun, interactive UI displaying a list of useless inventions  
- Users can add new inventions (stored in `localStorage`)  
- Voting system to rank the most useless inventions  
- Sorting and filtering options (e.g., newest, most votes, random)  
- Random "Useless Invention of the Day" feature  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Storage:** LocalStorage (to save user-submitted inventions)  

## Why This Project?  
This project is lightweight, fun, and still covers key web development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage. It allows me to practice structuring a project with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while keeping the experience engaging and interactive.
